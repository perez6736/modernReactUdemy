Notes from react course. 

THIS keyword--
3 stargeties on how to fix this keyword in call back not being the component 
    1. set up a constructor and bind the function to this
    2. set up the function as an arrow function inline 
    3. wrap where the function is being called as an arrow function. 

env vars related --  
react-scripts actually uses dotenv library under the hood. just add the REACT_APP_ prefix to be able to see it. 
A browser cannot access local or server environment variables so dotenv has nothing to look for.
